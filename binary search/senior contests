(here instead of calculus,we use binary search,to find the value at which function is minimum,that means here function is first decreasing and increasing.)


CODECHEF QUESTION:IT WAS SIMPLE BSOS ON SOLUTION.(BSOS-BINARY SEARCH OVER SOLUTION)

editorial-https://discuss.codechef.com/t/chef-garland-editorial/98151
in this problem,we do bsos over solution,as function(arr[i]) is monotonically increasing ,and we need to find maximum value of arr[i],where f(arr[i]) is <=m.
here we do bsos from 1 to max(arr[i]),as definitely solutions lies between this,as at max[a[i]],ans is atmost n,but given n<=m;so definitely solution exist.
**this question basically tests our idea of applying bsos,and also identifying limits for applying bsos**
we compare mid value's f(arr[i]) with m,and decide accoringly.
